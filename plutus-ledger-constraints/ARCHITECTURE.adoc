= `plutus-ledger-constraints` design

== Introduction

This document describes the design of the `plutus-ledger-constraints` library.
More specially, it describes

* how the constraint-based API is used to generate Plutus scripts and transactions.
* the rational behind the selected approach
* possible alternative approaches

== Specification

We define the constraints with the following data types.

[source,haskell]
----
data TxConstraints i o =
    TxConstraints
        { txConstraints :: [TxConstraint]
        , txOwnInputs   :: [ScriptInputConstraint i]
        , txOwnOutputs  :: [ScriptOutputConstraint o]
        }

data TxConstraint =
      MustHashDatum DatumHash Datum
    -- ^ The transaction's datum witnesses must contain the given 'DatumHash'
    -- and 'Datum'. Useful when you already have a 'DatumHash' and
    -- want to make sure that it is the actual hash of the 'Datum'.
    | MustIncludeDatum Datum
    -- ^ Like 'MustHashDatum', but the hash of the 'Datum' is computed automatically.
    | MustValidateIn POSIXTimeRange
    -- ^ The transaction's validity range must be set with the given 'POSIXTimeRange'.
    | MustBeSignedBy PaymentPubKeyHash
    -- ^ The transaction must add the given 'PaymentPubKeyHash' in its signatories.
    | MustSpendAtLeast Value
    -- ^ The sum of the transaction's input 'Value's must be at least as much as
    -- the given 'Value'.
    | MustProduceAtLeast Value
    -- ^ The sum of the transaction's output 'Value's must be at least as much as
    -- the given 'Value'.
    | MustSpendPubKeyOutput TxOutRef
    -- ^ The transaction must spend the given unspent transaction public key output.
    | MustSpendScriptOutput TxOutRef Redeemer
    -- ^ The transaction must spend the given unspent transaction script output.
    | MustMintValue MintingPolicyHash Redeemer TokenName Integer
    -- ^ The transaction must mint the given token and amount.
    | MustPayToPubKeyAddress PaymentPubKeyHash (Maybe StakePubKeyHash) (Maybe Datum) Value
    -- ^ The transaction must create a transaction output with a public key address.
    | MustPayToOtherScript ValidatorHash Datum Value
    -- ^ The transaction must create a transaction output with a script address.
    | MustSatisfyAnyOf [[TxConstraint]]

data ScriptInputConstraint a =
    ScriptInputConstraint
        { icRedeemer :: a -- ^ The typed 'Redeemer' to be used with the target script
        , icTxOutRef :: TxOutRef -- ^ The UTXO to be spent by the target script
        }

data ScriptOutputConstraint a =
    ScriptOutputConstraint
        { ocDatum :: a -- ^ Typed datum to be used with the target script
        , ocValue :: Value
        }
----

The `TxConstraints` can be combined with its `Semigroup` instance.
Values of `TxConstraints` are constructed using smart constructors like `mustBeSignedBy`, `mustPayToTheScript`, `mustSpendAtLeast`, etc. which are available in link:src/Ledger/Constraints/TxConstraints.hs[]

Here's an example for constructing constraints.

TESTTESTSETSETSET

[source,haskell]
----
include::../doc/plutus/tutorials/BasicAppConstraints.hs[tags=BLOCK1]
----

[source,haskell]
----
{-# INLINABLE myConstraints #-}
myConstraints :: PaymentPubKeyHash -> TxOutRef -> TxConstraints i o
myConstraints pkh ref = mustBeSignedBy pkh <> mustSpendPubKeyOutput ref
----

These constructed constraints can be used both to generate a transaction that satifies them using `mkTx` and to check wheter a given pending transaction meets the constrains using `checkScriptContext` which generates a Plutus validation function.
Here's an example.

[source,haskell]
----
{-# INLINABLE validate #-}
myValidator :: PaymentPubKeyHash -> TxOutRef -> () -> () -> ScriptContext -> Bool
myValidator pkh ref _ _ sc =
  checkScriptContext (myConstraints pkh ref) sc

mkMyTx :: PaymentPubKeyHash -> (TxOutRef, ChainIndexTxOut) -> Either MkTxError UnbalancedTx
mkMyTx pkh (ref, txOut) =
  let lookups = unspentOutputs (Map.singleton ref txOut)
   in mkTx lookups (myConstraints pkh ref)
----

== Rationale

In order to write and interact with Plutus script on the Cardano blockchain, one needs to:

* write a Plutus script which validates certain actions (like spending a transaction script output or minting a currency)
* create and submit transactions which create or spend a transaction output with the script's address.

Plutus scripts are written using Haskell, but there are multiple options for creating transactions.
The most notable option is to use the `cardano-cli` component of `cardano-node` to create, balance, sign and submit transactions.
`cardano-cli` provides a low-level way to create transactions in any era (Byron, Shelley, Alonzo, etc.).

However, `cardano-cli` is not a user-friendly way of creating transactions, especially when using the `cardano-api` Haskell library.
Also, the user has the burden of making sure that the created transaction is in sync with the related Plutus script.

Thus, we propose a high-level library to create transactions using a constraint-based API, which generates both a Plutus script and a transaction given a set of constraints.

=== Requirements

We have a number of requirements that we need to fulfil.

* users should be able to describe transactions using predefined constraints.
* transaction creation should be limited to the latest Cardano era.
* constraints should be able to generate a Plutus script as well as an unbalanced transaction

=== Argument

The definition of the constraints contain at least the information required by Plutus scripts.
The arguments behind this design choice are that:
* less information is needed to validate the spending of a transaction output, than to build a transaction.
* not all datatypes are permitted to be used in Plutus scripts (only builtin functions and data types from `plutus-tx` can be used)
* the more data we include in Plutus scripts, the higher the execution cost. TODO: Is this true? Or is this only true if we *actually* use this additionnal data in the validation code?

For example, one data constructor of `TxConstraint` is `MustSpendAtLeast Value`.
When generating validation code, this constraint returns `True` when the sum of the input `Value`s are greater than the provided `Value`.
However, when using this constraint to generate a transaction, we need to know who pays (`PaymentPubKeyHash`) for the missing value, if any.
Thus, this `PaymentPubKeyHash` needs to be provided through another mean (in our case, through a lookups value).

=== Limitations

There is one major drawback to this approach: the lookups value in transaction creation.
You need to provide the required lookups that are needed by the constraints.
The problem is that there is nothing linking a specific constraint to a specific lookup.
More spefically, there is nothing in the API (apart from reading the documentation) which prevents the users from providing an unrequired lookup, or forgetting to provide a required lookup.
The result is a runtime error, and not a compile error.

For example, there is nothing preventing the user from doing the following.

[source,haskell]
----
mkMyTx1 :: PaymentPubKeyHash -> TxOutRef -> Either MkTxError UnbalancedTx
mkMyTx1 pkh ref =
  let lookups = mempty -- Missing lookup for the transaction output reference
   in mkTx lookups (mustSpendPubKeyOutput ref)

mkMyTx2 :: PaymentPubKeyHash -> TxOutRef -> Either MkTxError UnbalancedTx
mkMyTx2 pkh ref =
  let lookups = ownPaymentPubKeyHash pkh -- Unnecessary lookup
   in mkTx lookups (mustSpendPubKeyOutput ref)
----

Both of these functions will return a `Left` value.

=== Alternatives

==== Integrating lookups in the constraints

The data constructors of `TxConstraint` could contain all the needed information for both the Plutus script and the transaction creation.

For example, we could replace `TxConstraint` with:

[source,haskell]
----
data TxConstraint =
    MustBeSignedBy PaymentPubKeyHash (Maybe PaymentPubKey)
    MustSpentPubKeyOutput TxOutRef ChainIndexTxOut
    MustSpendAtLeast PaymentPubKeyHash Value
    -- ... (OTHER CONSTRAINTS)
----

On the upside:

* the lookups are integrated in the constraints itself for the transaction creation.

On the downside:

* some of these additionnal types cannot be used in Plutus scripts such as `ChainIndexTxOut`.
* some of these additionnal types might increase cost of Plutus scripts. TODO: to validate
* the users has the burden of handling runtime errors such as not finding the `ChainIndexTxOut` of a `TxOutRef` from an external source.

==== Distinct isomorphic constraints

Instead of a single `TxConstraint` which is used for both Plutus scripts and creating transactions, we can create two distinct and isomorphic datatypes. TODO: Not sure if isomorphic is the right word here.

For example, we could replace `TxConstraint` with:

[source,haskell]
----
data ValidationTxConstraint =
    MustBeSignedBy PaymentPubKeyHash
    MustSpentPubKeyOutput TxOutRef
    MustSpendAtLeast Value
    -- ... (OTHER CONSTRAINTS)

data MkTxConstraint =
    MustBeSignedBy PaymentPubKeyHash (Maybe PaymentPubKey)
    MustSpentPubKeyOutput TxOutRef ChainIndexTxOut
    MustSpendAtLeast PaymentPubKeyHash Value
    -- ... (OTHER CONSTRAINTS)
----

On the upside:

* the lookups are integrated in the constraints itself for the transaction creation.
* we only include the minimum amount of required information in the Plutus script

On the downside:

* the user has the burden of maintining a correspondance between Plutus scripts constraints and transaction creation constraints.
* the users has the burden of handling runtime errors such as not finding the `ChainIndexTxOut` of a `TxOutRef` from an external source.
